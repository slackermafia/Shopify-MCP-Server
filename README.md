## Requirements

- Node.js 18+

## A note on Shopify's REST API

Shopify marked the REST Admin API as **legacy as of October 1, 2024**, with new public apps required to use GraphQL exclusively from April 2025 onward. This server uses the latest stable REST API version (`2026-01`) for broad compatibility with private/custom apps and is fully functional. The metaobjects, product taxonomy, publishing, and image upload features already use GraphQL. Future versions of this server may migrate remaining endpoints to GraphQL.
